## Exploratory data analysis on the world of boardgames
In this Exploratory data analysis I have explored the world of boardgames and provided significant insights for an imaginary future bar owner in his endeavor for opening a bar that includes boardgames and bar.
The EDA is seperated to 3 parts: Evaluating, Subsetting, and Predicting.

Evaluation: The data I've used includes 21631 boardgames from 3500 BCE up untill 2019, after thorough manual and visual graphs checks I've concluded that the Dataset is intact and useful.
Subsetting: I've subsetted the DataFrame to various factors to conclude which games in the DataFrame would be best to purchase for the boardgame bar, what boardgames are a must to have on the initial opening of the bar.
Predicting: I've looked for trends, correlations and predictions to ensure the EDA as futureproof and longlasting as possible for Mr. Barman to use in the years to come.

Both the subsetting and prediction parts were both intresting and suprising for me, a boardgame enthusiast, to explore.
The world of boardgames is so vast and intriguing, and spreads well beyond the popular and known monopoly, checkers, backgammon, jenga and such.

I believe there's much to explore in this realm of boardgames, always something new to discover and to connect over.
In this digital world sitting down to connect and escape reality together across all differences, something invaluable for our day to day lives.

Dig in to this EDA and discover a world unknown.
