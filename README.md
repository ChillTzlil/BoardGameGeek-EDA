###Exploratory Data Analysis: The World of Board Games
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the world of board games, aimed at providing valuable insights for a hypothetical future bar owner who plans to incorporate board games into their establishment. The analysis is divided into three main parts: Evaluation, Subsetting, and Predicting.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on 21,631 board games spanning from 3500 BCE to 2019. The data was thoroughly checked manually and through visual graphs to ensure its integrity and usefulness.

##Analysis
Evaluation
In the evaluation phase, the dataset was assessed to ensure its completeness and suitability for the analysis.

##Subsetting
The subsetting phase involved filtering the dataset based on various factors to determine which games would be best suited for the board game bar. This phase also aimed to identify essential games to have on hand for the bar's initial opening.

##Predicting
The predicting phase focused on identifying trends, correlations, and making predictions to ensure the longevity and future-proofing of the insights derived from the analysis. This phase aimed to provide the bar owner with a long-lasting and adaptable strategy for curating their board game collection.

##Insights and Discoveries
Throughout the subsetting and predicting phases, the analysis revealed interesting and surprising insights into the vast and intriguing world of board games, extending far beyond popular and well-known games like Monopoly, Checkers, Backgammon, and Jenga.

The analysis highlights the richness and diversity of the board game realm, offering opportunities for discovery, connection, and escapism across various backgrounds and interests.
